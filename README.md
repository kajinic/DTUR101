DTUR101 - Introduction to Applied Data Analysis with R
================

#### introduction

The aim of 'Introduction to Applied Data Analysis with R' is to introduce the [The R Project for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/) and the [Tidyverse framework](https://www.tidyverse.org/) to tidy, transform, visualise, model and communicate our data in the context of wet-lab bio-engineering. The course will run as a PhD+ course and participants are eligeble to collect 2.5 ECTS points.

The course will be taught by [Leon Eyrich Jessen](http://www.dtu.dk/service/telefonbog/person?id=22554&cpid=230023&tab=2&qt=dtupublicationquery) and consist of a series of [video lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4L59zaizb3FmBdxuDLRdzGsknTrZN6Ys) by [Morten Arendt Rasmussen](http://food.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/311655/), followed by hands-on exercises. Before each lecture you are expected to have seen the 1-2 videos. We will then start with discussing the videos and follow up with how to apply the concepts in R. This means that if the video includes a demonstration in R, you are of course welcome to see it - BUT it will not nessesarily be the demonstration we will work with at the exercises.

Non-exhaustive: We will cover descriptive statistics, data distribution, t-test (and a couple of others), PCA, data manipulation, exploration, visualisation and documentation in R.

The course will run in the spring semester (13-week period) of 2018, which according to the [DTU academic calendar](http://www.dtu.dk/english/education/student-guide/studying-at-dtu/Academic-calendar) is from 29/1 2018 to 8/5 2018, exluding holiday and non-teaching study breaks.
