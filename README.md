Course Introduction
===================

Aim
---

The aim of 'Introduction to Applied Data Analysis with R' is to introduce the [The R Project for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/) and the [Tidyverse framework](https://www.tidyverse.org/) to tidy, transform, visualise, analyse, model and communicate our data in the context of wet-lab bio-engineering. The course will run as a PhD+ course and participants are eligeble to collect 2.5 ECTS points.

Teacher
-------

The course will be taught by [Leon Eyrich Jessen](http://www.dtu.dk/service/telefonbog/person?id=22554&cpid=230023&tab=2&qt=dtupublicationquery) from the [Immunoinformatics and Machine Learning](http://www.bioinformatics.dtu.dk/english/Research_new/Health-informatics/Immunoinformatics-and-machine-learning) group at Department of Bio and Health Informatics at the Technical University of Denmark.

Scope and Form
--------------

The course consist of a series of [video lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4L59zaizb3FmBdxuDLRdzGsknTrZN6Ys) by [Morten Arendt Rasmussen](http://food.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/311655/), followed by hands-on exercises. Before each lecture students are expected to have seen the 1-2 videos. We will then start with discussing the videos and follow up with how to apply the concepts in R. This means that if the video includes a demonstration in R, you are of course welcome to see it - BUT it will not nessesarily be the demonstration we will work with at the exercises.

Recommended Prerequisites
-------------------------

It is expected that students have a basic knowledge of math and calculus and linear algebra equivalent to introductory university courses. No prior knowledge of programming is required.

Content
-------

Non-exhaustive: We will cover descriptive statistics, data distribution, t-test (and a couple of others), PCA, data manipulation, exploration, visualisation and documentation in R.

Schedule
--------

The course will run in the spring semester (13-week period) of 2018, which according to the [DTU academic calendar](http://www.dtu.dk/english/education/student-guide/studying-at-dtu/Academic-calendar) is from 29/1 2018 to 8/5 2018, exluding holiday and non-teaching study breaks.

Software
--------

Students are required to bring their own laptop and preferably install the following software before the first class

-   [R](https://mirrors.dotsrc.org/cran/)
-   [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

Course Timetable
================

Week 1 - Monday January 29th 2018 13-17
---------------------------------------

**Location**

-   The library at DTU Bioinformatics (building 208, room 027) at 1pm.

The first day we will focus on getting the software we need up and running. Then we will dive into programming in R. There will be a learning curve, I am fully aware of this, but I am confident that if you put the effort into climbing it, the reward will be well worth it. Programming is not only learning what to write when, but it is also learning a certain way of thinking - A new mindset if you will.

Please try to install R and RStudio before the first class

-   [R](https://mirrors.dotsrc.org/cran/)
-   [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

**Class Curriculum**

-   Installing R, RStudio and TidyVerse
-   Gentle introduction to programming in general and in R
-   If we have time, video: [1 - Descriptive Statistics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOYt84ZPTx0)

**Post Class**

Week 2 - Monday February 5th 2018 13-17
---------------------------------------

**Location**

-   Ly202-R8107-LIFE 1pm - 5pm

Based on what we learned in week 1, we will move onto some data visualisation using the `ggplot` package, which is part of the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) framework. The `tidyverse` framework is a particular take on how to do data analysis. It implements a philosophy where the work goes into getting your data into a well-defined format and once this is obtained, the different `tidyverse` functions can be applied to import-tidy-transform-visualise-model-communicate your data as illustrated in this figure (taken from [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/))

![](figures/data_cycle.png)

This means, that we will leave base R for now and henceforth we will continue our endevour using `Tidyverse`.

Please try to install `Tidyverse` before the class

-   In the console in RStudio, run this command: `install.packages('tidyverse')`

**Class Curriculum**

-   Recapitulation of previous class

Week 3 - Monday February 12th 2018 13-17
----------------------------------------

**Location**

-   Ly202-R8107-LIFE 1pm - 5pm

Now we have learned the basics of `R`, touched upon descriptive statistics and been introduced to `tidyverse` and `ggplot`. We continue with data visualisation and then turn to data distributions. We will take a closer at the normal distribution and also look at confidence intervals, when estimating population mean based on a sample.

Week 4 - Monday February 19th 2018 13-17
----------------------------------------

**Location**

-   Ly202-R8107-LIFE 1pm - 5pm

We have now become more familiar with `R` and we have tried to solve some simple tasks on our own. We have touched upon the normal distribution and used it to calculate some probabilities. We also discussed some properties of probability density functions. Now it is time to address how we state and test a hypothesis. Furthermore we will discuss how we interpret the result of a test and also possible errors. We will use the `t-test` as a point of reference for this.

**Class Curriculum**

-   Recapitulation of previous class
-   Briefly on cleaning data
-   The standard normal distribution
-   Statistical hypothesis
-   The `t-test`
-   Test statistics, p-values, level of significance, type I and II errors

Week 5 - Monday February 26th 2018 13-17
----------------------------------------

**Location**

-   NB! Class rescheduled to Friday March 2nd
-   Ly202-R8107-LIFE 1pm - 5pm

Last class we went over cleaning of data, the standard normal distribution, what constitutes a hypothesis in statistical terminology. Lastly we turned to manual implementation of a t-test and in that context discussed the connection between the test statistics and the p-value. I realise that it a bit more challenging, but please try to remember that it is natural to feel frustration when absorbing new knowledge. Especially in this case, where you have to absorb not only how-to-code-in-R, but also statistics and math, which does require a level of abstraction, which is challenging. See it as if you are trying to learn a new language, which in essense is quite comparable to what we are doing. We will go over the manual t-test for the `shoe_size` variable to ensure that we are all on the same page. Then I will introduce and discuss some more statistical terminology: Level of significance, Type I error, Type II error and power.

**Class Curriculum**

-   Recapitulation of previous class
-   Manual t-test for `shoe_size` variable in our data

Week 6 - Monday March 5th 2018 13-17
------------------------------------

**Location**

-   Ly202-R8107-LIFE 1pm - 5pm

We will spent some time on the exercises from last week and then go over the going over basic statistical concepts again, so we all agree on:

-   Descriptive statistics
-   Statistical inference (sample versus population)
-   The normal distibution (aka Gaussian)
-   Confidence intervals
-   The standard normal distribution (standard-/z-score normalisation)
-   Hypothesis testing (null versus alternative)
-   p-values
-   Level of significance
-   Power
-   Alpha values
-   Beta values
-   Type I error (False positives)
-   Type II error (False negatives)
-   Confusion matrices

If you are still uncertain on these concepts, please take a look again at the code from the last classes, rewatch some of the videos and try yo use google. Please feel free to mail me, if you have reached the level of destructive frustration. After this we will do the exercises on correlation and covariance.

We will start with briefly going over what we learned in the last class. Then we will briefly discuss correlation and causation and correction for multiple testing. Then we will turn to reduction of data dimensionality using PCA. I assume most of you have encountered PCA and I would like for you to understand what it is, what it does and how we can use it. Please watch the videos ahead of class.
